		<h1>My Codeup Learning Experience Blog</h1>
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>November 9, 2015 - Monday</h3>
		<p>
			<h5>
				Today marks the beginning of the 2nd of 16 total weeks spent at the codeup web development programming bootcamp. This won't be a particularly long or exciting post because I'm dog tired. However, in the name of science, I will talk a little bit about this experience thus far.
			</h5>
			<h5>
				First off, in spite of the expected fatigue associated with Mondays, we were all given a little jolt tonight in class. One of our instructors (and one of Codeup's very first students) had what appeared to be a grand mal seizure right in the middle of class. Fortunately this happened while he was in mid-conversation with me, so I was able to catch and guide him to the floor safely into the fetal position. He was pretty zapped afterwards and ended up transitioning into a pretty awesome mid-class nap. Not gonna lie - the fatigue I was feeling tonight almost made me a little jealous watching him doze. He looked pretty peaceful.
			</h5>
			<h5>
				Besides that, part of class included getting acquainted with the new space Codeup is in. They moved over the weekend to new digs up the street. Codeup now has its own entire floor in a cool vintage-looking building downtown. Anyhow, the new space is much more conducive to collaboration, which I imagine will become much more useful as we gain enough to skill to collaborate with.
			</h5>
			<h5>
				The purpose of this blog is multi-faceted. First and foremost, I need to reinforce the knowledge received during classroom hours. I think writing code every night will pay dividends towards my grasp of these new concepts. So far I feel like I'm doing alright, but there will undoubtedly be a point where I will need to outright teach myself something that perplexed me during class. Second, writing about what I learned in class forces me to articulate the information in the way I understand. They say teaching the material you are learning to someone else is one of the most effective ways to hard-wire it into your DNA. Thirdly, I will probably offer this site up to Codeup's leadership to use for future marketing. While I've yet to learn I'm God's gift to web development, I can see how a site like this could help with recruitment. Lastly, this little journey of mine could be informative for actual prospective students.
			</h5>
			<h5>
				This entry post is longer than I planned and ended up with zero coverage of actual learned programming content. Sorry, I'm just a little too tired for that part of my brain right now. I will include more web dev content and whatnot in future posts, but this blog is more about the experience of being a programming student at the Front End Web Development Bootcamp.
			</h5>
			<h5>
				I'm pretty sure that's all I've got left in the tank for tonight. Hasta la pasta!

				Class today was kind of an abortion. Our review of yesterday's lesson (Forms) went well. However, once we entered the realm of the ubiquitous source code manager GitHub, most of the lesson went haywire. Having worked ahead over the weekend, I was aware of potential problems associated with getting setup. The concept of GitHub is incredibly simple. It's almost the embodiment of open source in the tech realm. You build things that others can see, copy, alter that copy, and build more how they choose. None of this activity alters what you have done. The end. 
			</h5>
			<h5>
				To be fair, it's not that the instructors over-complicating SCM that is creating problems. They are forcing us to do everything from the command line, which I'm very happy about. However, this is a scary thing for a lot of people that might not have ever even used a mac, much less worked from the command line. I'm definitely no command line expert (nor mac at that), but I found working through the confusing parts of GitHub setup to be much easier on my own than during class. If we are ever asked to make suggestions or anything of the sort, I will probably suggest the instructors make the GitHub setup and navigation lessons homework. 
			</h5>
			<h5>
				I have checked out for the day. That's probably obvious since I'm writing today's blog post while still in class. I would probably head home to spend time with the fam, but it's a little early in the course for me to want to come across the wrong way to the cadre. We have the day off tomorrow for Veterans' Day, and I'm planning on spending at least a couple hours on code. I'm eager to move past these GitHub shenanigans and onto CSS!!!

			<h5>
				That's all for today kids.

				Veterans' Day, so no class. I was really hoping I'd get at least an hour or so to write some code, but this is my first opportunity. And it's technically not even today anymore. It's tomorrow. Today. Nevermind.
			</h5>
			<h5>
				The one thing worth mentioning is I have been thinking a lot over the last couple of days about what kind of sites or apps I can build. I am teaching a women's self-defense course in a few days, and was considering throwing together some pictures and descriptions for a very basic version of a syllabus, but then decided it's a bit late in the game for that - at least for this iteration. Maybe next time. Then, I began thinking about designing an app that could help address some of the inefficiences and boost productivity for that responsibilities associated with my missionary work. This might require some consultation with others in the organization, but I think there's value to be had there. I'll keep thinking on it, and perhaps I'll have something better for you tomorrow. However, I'm juggling quite a bit through the end of the week and weekend. I might not get to jump on here for any significant coding until the end of the weekend. We shall see. Until then, I bid you adieu.
