		<h3>What is MCMAP?</h3>
		The focus of Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP) is the personal development of each Marine in a team framework using a standardized, trainable, and sustainable close combat fighting system. As a weapon-based system, all techniques are integrated with equipment, physical challenges, and tactics found on the modern battlefield. The MCMAP is
		designed to increase the warfighting capabilities of individual Marines and units, enhance
		Marines' self-confidence and esprit de corps, and foster the warrior ethos in all Marines. The MCMAP is a weapon-based system rooted in the credo that every Marine is a rifleman and
		will engage the aggressor from 500 meters to close quarter combat.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>Where did MCMAP come from?</h3>
		The 1980s saw the development of the linear infighting neural-override engagement (LINE) system. The LINE system, developed in response to a perceived need for a standardized close combat system, was an important step in the evolution of a Marine Corps specific martial arts program. In 1996 a review of the LINE system, combat hitting skills, pugil stick training, and lessons learned from past programs were combined with the input of 10 subject matter experts from numerous martial arts disciplines to develop the Marine Corps Close Combat Program. This program combined all aspects of close combat into one program. In June 1999, Commandant James L. Jones detailed his vision of a martial arts program and, with his guidance, the close combat program underwent a period of testing and review that resulted in MCMAP. The MCMAP evolved into its present day form by combining the best combat-tested martial arts skills and time-honored close combat training techniques with proven Marine Corps core values and leadership training.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>What is the structure of MCMAP?</h3>
			The MCMAP consists of three disciplines: mental, character, and physical. Each discipline is divided and presented systematically to Marines at each belt level. Those disciplines taught at lower belt levels are then reviewed and reinforced during follow-on training and at the next belt level. Many skills specific to one discipline reinforce the strengths of the other disciplines. Martial culture studies strengthen the mental character of Marines through the historical study of war, at the same time reinforcing the importance of character to a warrior and a martial society. What makes this a complete program is the synergy of all three disciplines, which are inextricably linked to each other, and to the advancement process within the belt ranking system. Commanders are required to certify that the Marine meets annual training requirements and the prerequisites of each specific belt level and possesses the maturity, judgment, and moral character required for advancement. This ensures that as a Marine develops increased levels of lethality with additional physical skills, he also develops a commensurate level of maturity and self-discipline. 
	
		<p>	
			<h3>Mental Discipline</h3>
			Mental discipline creates a smarter Marine, who is capable of understanding and handling the complexity of modern warfare-a Marine who is tactically and technically proficient. This training begins with the transformation at recruit training and serves as the foundation of the future leadership of the Corps.
	
			<p>
				<h3>Warfighting</h3>
				study of art of war
				tactical decision-making training
				tactics, techniques, and procedures of expeditionary maneuver warfare
				marine corps common skills training
				force protection and operational risk management

				<h3>PME</h3>
				professional reading program
				martial culture studies
				historical study of war
				study of marine corps history, customs, courtesies, and traditions
			</p>		
		</p>

		<p>		
			<h3>Character Discipline</h3>
			Character discipline encompasses the study of the human dimensions of combat and has two main components: the Marine Corps core values program; which consists of honor, courage, and commitment, and the Marine Corps leadership training program; which consists of mentoring, and leadership schools and courses. This discipline is designed to instill the Marine Corps ethos into every Marine. Character discipline is the spiritual aspect of each Marine and the collective spirit of the Marine Corps. The components of the character discipline instill the warrior spirit in every Marine and emphasize the best traditions for developing esprit de corps, camaraderie, and a warrior mindset. By building the character of a Marine, the Marine develops as a warrior-defender who embodies the core values and who is self-disciplined, confident, and capable of making the right decision under any condition, from combat to liberty. The proverbial ethical warrior.
		</p>

		<p>
			<h3>Physical Discipline</h3>
			Physical discipline consists of two main components: fighting techniques and the combat conditioning program. The fighting techniques are trained as part of MCMAP, a weapons-based system beginning at assault fire and moving to the four elements of the fighting component (rifle and bayonet, edged weapons, weapons of opportunity, and unarmed combat). All four elements have a role across the entire spectrum of combat. The various armed and unarmed combat techniques are combined with physical preparedness into the Marine Corps combat conditioning program. It is the sinew of the Corps and prepares every Marine for his role as a basic rifleman-to seek out, close with, and destroy the enemy by fire and movement or repel his assault by fire and close combat. The Marine Corps combat conditioning program is battlefield oriented. Is based on being equipped for combat and develops the Marine's ability to overcome physical hardship and physical obstacles under any climatic condition and in any geographic location. Is designed on the philosophy that there are no time limits, level playing fields, or second chances in combat. Develops a physical toughness in every Marine that will translate into mental toughness. Produces Marines who possess combat fitness and the ability to handle any situation that confronts them.

		<p>
			<h3>Tactics and Techniques</h3>
			Achieving a Decision
			An indecisive fight creates a loss of energy and possibly Marines' lives. Whether the intent is to control an aggressor through restraint or defend themselves in war, Marines must have a clear purpose before engaging in close combat and act decisively once engaged.
		</p>

		<p>
			<h3>Gaining an Advantage</h3>
			A basic principle of martial arts is to use the aggressor's strength and momentum against him to gain more leverage than one's own muscles alone can generate, thereby gaining an advantage. Achieving surprise through deception or stealth can also greatly increase leverage. In close combat, Marines must exploit every advantage over an aggressor to ensure a successful outcome. This can include employing various weapons and close combat techniques that will present a dilemma to the aggressor. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<h3>Speed</h3>
			In close combat, the speed and violence of the attack against an aggressor provides Marines with a distinct advantage. Marines must know and understand the basics of close combat so that they can act instinctively with speed to execute close combat techniques.
		</p>

		<p>
			<h3>Adapting</h3>
			Close combat can be characterized by chaos, friction, uncertainty, disorder, and rapid change. Each situation is a unique combination of shifting factors that cannot be controlled with precision or certainty. For example, a crowd control mission may call for Marines to employ various techniques ranging from nonlethal restraint to more forceful applications. Marines who adapt quickly will have a significant advantage. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<h3>Exploiting Success</h3>
			An aggressor will not typically surrender simply because he was placed at a disadvantage. Marines cannot be satisfied with gaining an advantage in a close combat situation. Marines must exploit any advantage aggressively and forcefully until an opportunity arises to completely dominate the aggressor. Marines must exploit success by using every advantage that can be gained.
